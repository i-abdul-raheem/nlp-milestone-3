# üß† Multi-Label Emotion Classifier using BERT

This project is a multi-label emotion classification system built with **BERT** and **PyTorch**. It can detect multiple emotions (e.g., anger, joy, fear) in a single piece of text. The model is trained and evaluated using standard NLP preprocessing, Hugging Face Transformers, and custom metrics.

## üöÄ Features

- BERT-based architecture for contextual language understanding
- Supports multiple simultaneous emotion labels per input
- Clean text preprocessing pipeline
- Evaluation metrics: Hamming Loss, Micro-F1, Macro-F1
- Easy prediction on custom input text

## üßæ Emotion Labels

The classifier supports the following emotion labels:

- Anger
- Fear
- Joy
- Sadness
- Surprise
